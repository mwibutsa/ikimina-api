# Ikimina API

This is the backend API for the Ikimina application, which helps users organize, join, and manage money-rounds (rotating savings groups).

## Features

- User authentication and registration
- Create and join money-round groups
- Self-draw or admin-shuffle position mechanisms
- Payment tracking and management
- Group messaging
- Admin verification using admin codes

## Tech Stack

- NestJS - Backend framework
- Prisma - ORM
- PostgreSQL - Database
- JWT - Authentication
- TypeScript - Language

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- PostgreSQL
- Yarn

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ikimina-api.git
cd ikimina-api
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/ikimina?schema=public"

# JWT
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="7d"

# App
PORT=3000
```

Make sure to update the DATABASE_URL with your PostgreSQL credentials.

### 4. Generate Prisma client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 5. Run migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 6. Start the development server

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000/api`.
